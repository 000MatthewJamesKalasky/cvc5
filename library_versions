# Format is CVC4-RELEASE-VERSION-REGEXP (LIBRARY:VERSION)*
#
# This file contains library version release information.
# Lines are matched while processing configure.ac (and generating
# the configure script) using the CVC4_RELEASE_STRING.  Lines are
# matched on the regexp in the first column, with only the first
# matching line counting.  The library versions following, one per
# column, are then used.  If there are no matching lines, an error
# is raised and the configure script is not generated.
